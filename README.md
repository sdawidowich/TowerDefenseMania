# TowerDefenseMania

Basic tower defense game made in C++ using the SFML library.

The goal of this game is to survive as long as you can against incoming waves of enemies. When the enemies read the end of the path, they do damage to your health. When your health reaches 0, the game is over.
To defend against the enemies, you must build towers using gold that is earned from killing those enemies. Different towers have different ranges, attack damage, and gold cost.
